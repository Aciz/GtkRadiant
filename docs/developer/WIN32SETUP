Summary of TODO and BUGS for GtkRadiant setup files on win32:

(most of the times the stuff has to be checked in both versions of the setup)

- installer back button is broken
OK (it just bails out if you try to back instead)

- need proper setup splash screen
  is there someone skilled with gimp at loki :) ?
OK (Maj did)

- don't have several files for license and readme .. use a central version
  (scripts or proper settings in InstallShield)
  in private/GtkRadiant/data <- where we put all the install specific stuff?
  NOTE: we could put the gtk.dll libs there as well
OK

- remove curry from the alpha (it's still MFC)
  remove GenSurf as well .. try to get some info from David Hyde
OK

- have a changelog for the end user (not the DevDocs/CHANGES kind of thing)
    something that focuses on features and bug fixes more than on the internals
OK .. need to fill it up a bit

- use quakev2.qe4 instead of quake.qe4 (both in nomedia and full)
    added it in the advanced files section
    (need to prompt the user about overwriting it)
    for now the nomedia installation needs to run on top of 202
OK

- fix bug with shaders names (skies and liquids)
OK

- add Wolfen to the credits!
OK
