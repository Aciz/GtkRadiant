THIS FILE IS OFFICIALLY OUTDATED CLOSED NO LONGER USED

All the stuff that needs to be settled for win32 beta of GtkRadiant:

- need to add more code checking BSP process execution (Q_Exec or engine spawning)
(TTimo: Assigned to self)

- the BSP commands are switching in order randomly

- Need more error checking when executing q3map (in any mode)
	(Q_Exec goes out of resources sometimes)

- Region compiling is broken

- GL font on win32 uses the default system font .. which can be .. yiddish or cyrilic etc.
	force to courier?
	NOTE: actually I'm not sure this really is the problem .. some people are getting weird bitmap fonts

- view n2 needs to wake on whatever widget you raise first
Fixed.

- entity information box on entity inspector displays with nasty characters
	maybe the same problem as above?

- map snapshot has a bug (allocation and stuff around Str class)
OK (don't use CString stuff = other_stuff; do CString stuff; stuff = other_stuff;)

- sleep mode on view 2&3 crashing
Fixed for the floating windows mode.

- sleep mode: need to bring back the bitmap fonts
Fixed

- sleep mode: need to rebuild the data on models and patches! (call Map_BuildBrushData)
Calling Map_BuildBrushData in Mainframe::OnSleep.
OK (added some crap to reload) ... Maybe more to do

- sleep mode: need to trigger out sleep mode when raising again!
Done.

- console: we want output while it's processing .. otherwise it's just useless ..
OK!

- win32 help format distribution of the manual?

- update the links page, add stuff from the forum
  (TTimo .. will do)

- check maximized state is working(?)

<<<<<<< WIN32BETA
- view n.3 crashes on exit in MainFrame::OnDestroy..
    (trying to save prefs)

Fixed.
=======
- remove high color textures from prefs .. remnant from Q2 .. always on .. off is broken anyway
Done.

- test sleep mode!

- check my project template bug checking code is ok
  NOTE: it's fuxored. Need a central function to shrink and standardize file paths:
    lowercase
    short dos8.2 names
    unix style forward slashes /
    -> then perform the comparisons

- surface and patch inspector:
[23:37] <G_DeWan> WHen you make adjustments in surface window, it should show results immediately. Pressing Apply after each change to see how it looks is a pain.
[23:41] <TTimo> true
[23:42] <TTimo> is it the behaviour of the MFC version or not?
[23:42] <TTimo> on the MFC version when you make adjustements it updates on the fly right?
[23:43] <G_DeWan> Yeah.
[23:44] <G_DeWan> ANd the fit and axial buittons do not seem to do anything, even if you press Apply afterwords.
[23:44] <G_DeWan> HDidn't check patches at all, don't know about them.
Fixed

- check the engine path changes I made didn't break on linux

- user INI path in prefs: need to look into it .. but my guess is .. it's broken/useless

- view n.2: doesn't remember the window positions
Fixed

- view n.2: the Z window doesn't shrink below the default size
Fixed

- do some performance comparisons with 202
  (specially BrushBuild step)

- a quickstart.txt file with some explanations about the transition 202 -> GtkRadiant?
  like:
    what are the actual new features
      (new way to deal with project settings, sleep mode, net connect for BSP process)
    what are we testing in the alpha
    where to report bugs, who is doing what
    how to contribute as a coder
  some of this stuff goes into the changelog!
>>>>>>> 1.15

- is there a way to have something actually drawing when moving the splitters?

- view n.4: the Z window gets pushed when you resize with the leftmost vertical splitter

- disable the groups view (it's not functional)
Fixed

- floating windows mode (n.2 in prefs):
    if a message gets printed, the console will raise up. But if something else was active
    (like Entities) .. the widgets are still active .. start moving the mouse on top of
    the entity window and stuff will start to appear

- floating windows mode (n.2 in prefs):
    when moving in the 2D window the console outputs lots of error messages:
    ERROR: glXMakeCurrent failed.. Error:0
    Please restart Q3Radiant if the Map view is not working
    but everything seems to work fine, no graphic glitches

- floating windows mode (n.2 in prefs):
    the Z window doesn't resize

- more window position storage, store maximized state and position on the desktop
Note: maximized state doesn't exist under X, it depends on the WM.

- keyboard shortcuts break if click in the console window, it keeps the focus..
Fixed (using GtkText again).

<<<<<<< WIN32BETA
- upgrade to latest Gtk distribution (there's been a new release) and make sure we are ok

- enable undo/redo

Fixed.

- make sure the BSP monitoring stuff is stored in registry

- remove the "Buggy GL driver" thing, we'll use another strategy for hardware-specific issues

- remove the QE4 update model, force always on

- assertion failed when raising the prefs box for the first time?

=======
>>>>>>> 1.15
- use the other view modes to check nothing's wrong with them

- win32 console doesn't release the focus if you click into it
  it also has resize issues .. doesn't seem to want to shrink down
Fixed the focus problem (using GtkText again).

- some problems with file permissions under linux?
    seems it used to create the log and pid file with no write permissions for the user
    ends up that when you try to open the console file for output it fails or the .pid remains when you try to erase it
		(NOTE: I need someone with an old install to check that)
		on win32 more or less same problem. It's created with an archive flag that
    fordibs removal as well.
<<<<<<< WIN32BETA

Fixed: missing fclose in main.cpp that could be causing this problem.
=======
leo: there was a missing fclose in main.cpp that could be causing this problem.
>>>>>>> 1.15

- engine path / project loading
  when we load a template project file we are using the engine path to build it
  if user has several installs and old prefs that rely on another engine path, project
    template construction fails. (i.e. is still based on old engine path)
    I don't know how to solve: 
      -check the engine path when we do the template thing?
      -check engine path at each project load
  actually we can check everytime and ask the user, it seems this happens in weird cases
  .. anyway it's not supposed to be a "stable" situation anytime

- make sure the BSP monitoring stuff is stored in registry
OK (added)

- the Radiant logo is screwed in the about dialog box?
OK (Leo:) The logo.bmp file in the CVS server is screwed, fixed.

- remove the "Buggy GL driver" thing, we'll use another strategy for hardware-specific issues
OK (Leo fixed)

- engine path dialog is broken (need split to get the actual path)
OK (splitting the path, can't edit it must go through the dialog)

- assertion failed when raising the prefs box for the first time?
WORKSFORM (can't reprodcue this one)
leo: Used to happen sometimes for me (not anymore ?)

- view n.3 crashes on exit in MainFrame::OnDestroy..
    (trying to save prefs)
Fixed

- remove the QE4 update model, force always on
Done.

- custom keyboard shortcuts is buggy .. works halfway
OK all fixed

- upgrade to latest Gtk distribution (there's been a new release) and make sure we are ok
OK (tested and stuff .. I'm using the latest in the setup)

- enable undo/redo
leo: it's already enabled
(ok fixed, had to enable back the menus)
OK

- project settings. GtkRadiant uses a new version of project settings.
Default name is quakev2.qe4
Must be able to read old project settings as well .. BSP monitoring disabled
if using old project settings
When searching for project settings, will look for quakev2.qe4 first, then quake.qe4
No more overwriting the loaded project settings. We detect "template" project settings
(ie. the ones we distribute) with a "user_project" "1" keyval
When a template is loaded, save as userxx.qe4 where xx = 1 2 3 4 5 6 etc.
It will trash scripts/ a bit but it doesn't matter ..

I did some cleanup to the project code, tested on both linux and win32, will need more
testing and stuff while in alpha/beta I guess. But it should be stabilized now.

OK

-unify the project file syntax on both platforms! (and yes, the problem is
  radiant on linux is in quake3/ instead of quake3/tools)
	the expansion rules are not the same between version 1 and v2 project files!
	we change the string names so we don't have to adapt..
	NOTE: later we'll remove support for old v1 syntax?
	NOTE: we may need to add a g_strHomePath for ~/.q3a/ on linux

see above, the v2 project file is in data/quakev2.qe4

OK

- preferences dialog for BSP monitoring: do / don't do, launch engine after
  compilation.
	Right now all the params are in prefs, just need the interface

OK, need more testing, and the sleep mode code 
.. may also want to add more configurable stuff later .. though I'd rather have it done
by a plugin
	
- in QE_LoadProject, check the template reading works ok, specially with the new
globals Leo added some time ago

OK, tested on both win32 and linux
